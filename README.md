# Baby Names Multi

Baby Names Multi is a variant of my original Baby Names app. This new version creates a line chart that helps a user compare the relative popularity of various baby names over time. The data comes from the [U.S. Social Security Administration](http://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/).
